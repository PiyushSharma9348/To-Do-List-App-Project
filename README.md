# To-Do-List-App-Project
A To-Do List application created during my Codsoft internship
This To-Do List application was developed as part of my internship at Codsoft. The project aims to help users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. The application is built using Python and provides a command-line interface (CLI) for creating, updating, and tracking tasks on a to-do list.
